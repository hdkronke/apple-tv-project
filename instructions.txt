1. Creating a user in postgres
    This is necessary in order to create the connection to the postgres database via sql alchemy/pyscopg2
    Make sure to give the user a password and keep note of the following: user , password , hostname , port and database name.
    Follow this link to create the user: https://www.enterprisedb.com/postgres-tutorials/how-create-postgresql-database-and-users-using-psql-and-pgadmin

    scroll down to the section 'Using pgAdmin'

Also I renamed the 'id' column in the credits table to 'title_id'.
ALTER TABLE credits
RENAME id TO title_id

and I also created a primary key for the credits table as well. You will need to do this in order to make the connection. 

ALTER TABLE credits
ADD  unique_id  serial PRIMARY KEY 

2. Creating config file (optional)

This is just a file that houses my postgres credentials so they can't be seen. You can just store yours in variables if you want to.

Create a  file called credentials.conf

In it put the following:

[postgres_config]
host_name = your hostname
db_name = apple_tv
user =  user
password = password 
port = 5432

I added a .gitignore file to the repo so your config file will not sync to it. 

Message me if you have any questions!
